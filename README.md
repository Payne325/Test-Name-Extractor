# Test-Name-Extractor
A small program to extract C# automated test names into a file. 
The intention is that this will be a tool used to speed up the creation of specification documentation.

It's written in C# and Visual Studio 2013, mainly because its designed for use with C# in the Visual Studio environment. 

It's designed as a console application, input arguments are the filepaths to the files you wish to extract test names from.

When running this from visual studio, you will need to change the command line arguments in the settings for the TestNameParser Project.

Feel free to use, modify and share this to your heart's content.
